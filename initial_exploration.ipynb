    "##### It appears that the variables **'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', and 'Adj Close'** exhibit a strong positive correlation with each other, indicating their high association with price-related factors. However, there wasn't a significant lead-lag relationship found between the variables 'Volume' and 'fluctuation rate'. Nonetheless, in the case of **'Volume'**, a lead relationship of **0.727335** was observed with **'High'**, suggesting a correlation between higher trading volumes and higher prices."

    "# What feature/s would you like to be able to predict?\n",
    "- To predict the characteristics that form a high price range, various factors related to high prices need to be considered. These may include not only the 'High' variable but also other price-related variables such as 'Open,' 'Low,' 'Close,' 'Adj Close,' and more. Additionally, trading volume is considered a crucial factor influencing high prices. Analyzing these variables collectively enables the prediction of features contributing to the formation of a high price range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similarly, predicting the characteristics forming a low price range involves a comparable approach. By considering variables related to low prices, such as 'Open,' 'High,' 'Low,' 'Close,' 'Adj Close,' along with trading volume, it is possible to predict features contributing to the formation of a low price range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trading volume plays a significant role in predicting both high and low prices. High trading volume can be considered a signal that may influence stock price movements, either upward or downward. Therefore, leveraging trading volume information can be helpful in predicting both high and low price ranges."
